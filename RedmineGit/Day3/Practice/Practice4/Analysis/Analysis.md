step1:start
     step2:decalre variables n ,j,i,temp
     step3:read value of n
     step4:decalre the arr size of n
     step5:initialize value zero into i
     step6:if i< n gotostep7 if isn't goto step8
     step7:read the value of arr and increase  value of i by one
     step8:initialze i =1
     step9: if i< n goto step 10 if isn't then goto step12
     step10: initialize j=i
     step11:ifj>0&&arr[j-1]>arr[j] then apply swap and decrease j by one if isn't then decreased i by one and goto step9
     step12: reinitialize i=0 
     step13: if i< n then print arr[i] and increase i by one else goto next step
     step14:end program
