step1:start
step2:decalre variables i and size
step3:read value of n
step4:decalre the arr size of n
step5:initialize value zero into i
step6:if i< n gotostep7 if isn't goto step8
step7:read the value of arr and increase  value of i by one
step8: locally declare variables i and j 
step9: if i< size goto step10 if isn't then goto  step14
step10: initialize j=i
step11: if j< size goto next step if isn't then goto step9 and increase i by one
step12: if arr[i]>arr[j] then apply swap fun and increase j by one and goto step11
step13: if arr[i]!>arr[j] then just increase j by one and goto step11
step14: reinitialize i =0 
step15: i< size then print arr[i] else goto next step
step16; end program
