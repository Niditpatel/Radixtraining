step1:start
step2:decalre variables n ,j,i,swap
step3:read value of n
step4:decalre the arr size of n
step5:initialize value zero into i
step6:if i<n gotostep7 if isn't goto step8
step7:read the value of arr and increase  value of i by one
step8:ifi<n-1 goto step9 if isn't then goto step11
step9: declare j and put 0 in it and apply j< n-i-1 if it's true goto step10
step10: if arr[j]>arr[j+1] then apply swap on it and increase j by one if isn't increase i by one and goto step8
step11: locally decalre i and put value 0 init
step12:if i<n print arr[i] if isn't goto next step
step13: end the program
