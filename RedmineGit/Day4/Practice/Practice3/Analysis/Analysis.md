step1: start
step2: decalre var i and n
step3 : get the value of n
step4: declare the arr of size n
step5: initialize i=0
step6: if i< n then get  arr value and increase value of i by one else goto next step
step6: decalre fl and sl and assign arr[0] to them
step7: reinitioalize i with 0
step8: if i< n then goto next step
step9: if fl< x[i] do  sl = fl;fl = x[i]; and increase i by one  and goto step8 else if x[i] > sl && x[i] != fl then do sl = x[i]; and increase i by one and goto step8
step10: if fl=sl then print sl and fl both else print sl
step11: end the program.
