STEP1: Strat the program.
STEP2: Declare the variables number , n1, n2, nextterm.
STEP3: Read the number from user.
STEP4: Initialize the variables n1=0 and n2=1.
STEP5: Print the first two terms of series.
STEP6: Run loop until i reach the number (a) nexttearm = n1+n2 (b) n1= n2 (c) n2=nextterm (d) increase the value of i by 1 (e) print he value of nextterm.
STEP7: End the loop.
STEP8: End.
