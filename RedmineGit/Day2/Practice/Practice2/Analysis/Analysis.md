step1: start
step2: get the value of n
step3: if i<=n goto step 4 if not goto step7
step4: if j>i then print space and decrease j by one if j!=n goto step6
step5: if k<!*2 -1 print star and increase k by one till condition true
step6: break the line and increase i by one the goto step 3  
step7: if i<=n-1 goto step if isn't then goto last step
step8: if j<i print space and increase j by one if isn't goto step9
step9: assign value to k and check if k>0  then print star else goto step10
step10: break line and increase i by one and goto step7
step11: end the program.
